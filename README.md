# We-KAN: All Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks We Know
This repository gathers all known Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (including those I developed) from various sources. These networks are implemented for image classification on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. I hope this collection inspires you and the broader research community to advance the development of even better KANs in the future.

Feel free to suggest or integrate your KAN into this repositoryâ€”contributions are always welcome!
