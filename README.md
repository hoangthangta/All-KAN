# We-KAN: All Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks We Know
This repository brings together all known Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (including those I developed), gathered from various sources. These networks are implemented for image classification on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. I hope this collection inspires you and the broader research community to advance the development of even better KANs in the future.
